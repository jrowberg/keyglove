 * This file defines all of the selectable options which you may want to use in
 * the "config.h" file. If you create new functionality which a modular add-on
 * beyond the already implemented Keyglove code, it should be defined here as a
 * new option and then enabled as a module in the "config.h" file. This file
 * will not normally need to be modified.
