/**
 * @file application.cpp
 * @brief **USER-DEFINED:** Custom application behavior definition
 * @author Jeff Rowberg
 * @date 2014-11-07
 *
 * Use this file to define any autonomous behavior the firmware should have. By
 * default, the processor will boot into what would be considered "idle" mode,
 * available for KGAPI control from an external host but otherwise not really
 * doing anything. Using custom event handlers, you can trigger actions based on
 * API events, such as boot/reset, Bluetooth ready, touch status changing, etc.
 *
 * Technically these custom event handlers could go anywhere in the codebase,
 * but it makes sense to centralize everything in one place for simplicity. You
 * will most likely not need to modify any other source files (except possibly
 * the "config.h" file which defines the modular hardware configuration), unless
 * you are intentionally changing or adding to the low-level functionality of
 * the Keyglove codebase.

 * similar to a "main()" entry point in C, or the "setup()" function in an
 * Arduino sketch. Note that the "system_boot" event may seem intuitive for
